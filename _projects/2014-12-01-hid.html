Humanitarian ID is a single contact management app for everyone working in humanitarian crises and disasters. It was first deployed during the Nepal earthquake and is now being used in more and more countries. Reliefweb endorses Humanitarian ID and is looking at integrating the Humanitarian ID authentication service as well as other features.
