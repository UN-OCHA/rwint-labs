Started testing April 2014<br>
Decommissioned October 2017<br>

A prototype combining ReliefWeb content, through the API, with data from other sources such as Twitter and UNDP's Human Development Index. The code was open-sourced, so that developers could improve and extend its capabilities. It was an interesting pilot for mixing content from different sources through their APIs. As the user base was low, though, we didn't make this a priority and the codebase became outdated.
