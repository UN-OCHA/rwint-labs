Building queries for the ReliefWeb API can quickly become complex for anything beyond very simple queries and filters. A quick solution is to use the filters and advanced search on the ReliefWeb site to narrow down the content, and then copy and paste the url to the <a href="https://reliefweb.github.io/search-converter/">search converter</a> which will transform it to a GET or POST request that the API will understand.
