Emalsys is an online platform to help humanitarian organisations manage their emergency rosters. It allows users to visualize in real time available responders, access their profile, location and skill set to deploy them efficiently to the field. Emalsys was developed in partnership with the IFRC Emergency Response Units and designed to be used by any organisation. The quick alert launcher is powered by the ReliefWeb API and the system has more than 1750 users from over 60 organisations.
