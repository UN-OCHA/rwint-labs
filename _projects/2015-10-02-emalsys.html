Emalsys is a tool to help humanitarian organisations manage their emergency rosters. Visualize in real time who is available, access their profile, location and set of skills to deploy them efficiently to the field. Emalsys was developed in partnership with the <a href="http://ifrc.org/eru">IFRC Emergency Response Units</a> and designed to be used by any organisation. The quick alert launcher is powered by the ReliefWeb API and will be released mid-October 2015.
