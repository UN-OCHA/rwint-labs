This was an early pilot by OCHAâ€™s Visual Information Unit to develop a timeline map to display humanitarian information, situation timelines and maps. While this particular pilot is out of date, interactive content has really caught on: ReliefWeb now has an <a href="https://reliefweb.int/updates?format=38974#content">'Interactive' format filter</a>, a shortcut for <a href="https://reliefweb.int/maps#content_top">Maps and Infographics</a> and a growing collection of <a href="https://reliefweb.int/maps?source=1503&format=38974#content">OCHA Infographics</a>.
