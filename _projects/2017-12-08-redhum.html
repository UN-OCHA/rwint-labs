Since 2007, RedHum (Red de Información Humanitaria para América Latina y el Caribe) has gathered humanitarian information for Central and South American countries in Spanish to offer up-to-date information and help regional decision-making in managing disasters. In 2017, RedHum was rebuilt to use content direct from the ReliefWeb API, streamlining the editorial workflow and the technical requirements.
