The Humanitarian Encyclopedia Dashboard is a visualization tool built to study corpora of humanitarian texts. It includes full-text content of ReliefWeb reports in three languages: English, French and Spanish (about 1 million texts and 2 billion words). Users can query RW content to view trends in humanitarian discourse and conduct analyses using the Sketch Engine corpus linguistics software. 
To test a demo version of the app based on Humanitarian Encyclopedia data, visit https://humanitarianencyclopedia.org/analysis.
