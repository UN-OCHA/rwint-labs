A dedicated, independent service allowing members of the humanitarian community, verified through <a href="https://humanitarian.id/" rel="noopener">Humanitarian ID</a>, to publish information about upcoming meetings, conferences and trainings. The site was built to be compatible with <a href="https://humanitarianresponse.info" rel="noopener">Humanitarian Response</a> and any other humanitarian site. It may still be revived, but in the meantime, given its limited usage and ongoing security and maintenance costs, the project has been taken offline.
