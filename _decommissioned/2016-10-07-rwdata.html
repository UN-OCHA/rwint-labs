Matching data from the ReliefWeb API with visitor information from Google Analytics, this stand-alone site took over from Content Trends. It was useful to give an overview of content popularity and to compare content with different criteria. But as with ReliefWeb Lite, the site required constant maintenance and the Reliefweb team discontinued it. The figures can still be accessed through the API and Google Analytics, although some manual processing is needed. See the <a href="https://reliefweb.int/blogpost/reliefweb-data-snapshots-rw-usage-analysis-powered-reliefweb-api-and-google-analytics">related blog post</a> for more information.
