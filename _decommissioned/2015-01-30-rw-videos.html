Started testing January 2015<br>
Decommissioned December 2017<br>

To keep track of humanitarian information conveyed by video, ReliefWeb experimented with a dedicated section. As an experimental feature, it was not strongly marketed, but country, disaster and organization playlists were prominently displayed, and there was a dedicated videos app. As videos are expensive to make and most humanitarian videos were not very popular on ReliefWeb, there was little return on the editorial effort to curate them. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ReliefWeb/playlists">playlists still exist</a> but are not being updated (except for those shown on <a href="https://redhum.org">Redhum</a>). Do <a href="https://reliefweb.int/contact">contact us</a> if you'd like more information.
