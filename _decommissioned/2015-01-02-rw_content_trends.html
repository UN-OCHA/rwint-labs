An interactive way of analyzing ReliefWebâ€™s extensive humanitarian information database from the beginning. Content Trends displayed 'meta' information about the content on ReliefWeb - how many reports were displayed each year, for example, for which themes and broken down by organization. This was decommissioned in favor of RW Data Snapshots.
