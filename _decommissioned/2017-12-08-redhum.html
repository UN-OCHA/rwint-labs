Since 2007, RedHum (Red de Información Humanitaria para América Latina y el Caribe) has gathered humanitarian information for Central and South American countries in Spanish to offer up-to-date information and help regional decision-making in managing disasters. In 2017, RedHum was rebuilt to use content direct from the ReliefWeb API, streamlining the editorial workflow and the technical requirements. You can now find the same information within <a href="https://reliefweb.int/topics/am-rica-latina-y-el-caribe" rel="noopener">ReliefWeb</a>.
