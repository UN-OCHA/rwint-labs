RW Apps gave direct access to streamlined information from the site. RW Crises combined key figures with news and reports for countries with ongoing humanitarian situations. RW Jobs and RW Headlines kept users informed of updates relevant to them and available offline and RW Videos was a showcase for the Videos section. The apps were well-received, but didn't register sufficient use or positive feedback to justify the increasing burden of maintaining them.
