A very light and quick site showing ReliefWeb content, without any javascript and a simple, minimal design that worked on all browsers. Borrowing some improvements from ReliefWeb Lite, <a href='https://m.reliefweb.int'>version 2</a> is still very light and quick and works on all browsers, but with an improved design, better accessibility and a little bit of javascript to allow it to work offline.
