Started testing December 2017<br>
Decommissioned June 2018<br>

This was a prototype to test ideas and deliver them through a new technical framework. As a legacy of this project, we reworked our mobile site <a href="https://m.reliefweb.int">m.reliefweb.int</a>, which is now more accessible, has a new responsive design (performing well on low-bandwidth connections even on wide screens), looks and feels more similar to other OCHA sites, works as a Progressive Web App and stores viewed reports so they're still readable offline.
