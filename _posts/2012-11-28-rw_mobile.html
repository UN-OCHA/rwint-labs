The future is mobile, and we want to make it easy to read ReliefWeb on mobile phones. We'll start with a version of ReliefWeb optimized for small screens, then continue to build features that would help humanitarians on the go. We'd love to <a href='http://feedback.reliefweb.int/reliefweb/products/reliefweb_labs'>hear your ideas</a>.
