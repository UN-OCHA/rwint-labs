The new disaster pages will aggregate global analytical and in-depth reports by disaster type. They will display a dynamic world map with the disasters that ReliefWeb is covering as well as alerting on potential new events. They will also offer resources to practitioners on each disaster type such as trend analysis, key reports, main players, etc.
